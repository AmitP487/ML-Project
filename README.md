# ML-Project
Predicting Term Deposit Subscription by a client

<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

Marketing campaigns are characterized by focusing on the customer needs and their overall satisfaction. Nevertheless, there are different variables that determine whether a marketing campaign will be successful or not. There are certain variables that we need to take into consideration when making a marketing campaign. A Term deposit is a deposit that a bank or a financial institution offers with a fixed rate (often better than just opening a deposit account) in which your money will be returned back at a specific maturity time.

<strong>Problem Statement</strong>

Predict if a customer subscribes to a term deposit or not, when contacted by a marketing agent, by understanding the different features and performing predictive analytics

<strong>Dataset Information</strong>

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to assess if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. The dataset consists of several predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the age, job, marital status, and so on

<strong>AIM AND OBJECTIVE</strong>

The Main aim of this project is to predict the customers using machine learning and to showcase the different dimensions in it and with machine learning what we can achieve and it helps us to solve real world problems.

For this project we used machine learning using python because ML provides better result for prediction by constructing different models from the datasets collected from various patients.

The Objective of this project is to develop a system which can predict if a person will subscribe to a term deposit with a higher accuracy by machine learning techniques. To achieve this goal, we gathered dataset from UCI repository. It contains 41188 instances and 21 attributes with no missing values.
